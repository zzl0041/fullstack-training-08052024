/*
Build a tabs component that displays one panel of content at a time depending on the active tab element. 
Some HTML is provided for you as example contents.

Requirements
  - Clicking on a tab makes it the active tab. Add a visual indication (e.g. using blue text color) for 
    the active tab to differentiate it from the non-active tabs.
  - At all times, only one panel's contents should be displayed â€” the one corresponding to the active tab's.
Notes
  - The focus of this question is on functionality, not the styling. 
    There's no need to write any custom CSS except for highlighting the active tab.
  - You may modify the markup (e.g. adding ids, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc) and use client-side rendering instead.
  - You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the application and 
    implement them (you get bonus credit for doing that during interviews).
